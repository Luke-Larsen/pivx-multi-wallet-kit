//! The shielded fee model must cover the transaction it prices, and at the
//! shielded rate every missed byte costs a hundred times what it does on the
//! transparent path.
//!
//! PIVX charges a shielded transaction the ordinary relay fee for its total
//! size, multiplied by `K = DEFAULT_SHIELDEDTXFEE_K = 100`, in
//! `GetShieldedTxMinFee` (`src/validation.cpp`, `src/validation.h`). With
//! `minRelayTxFee = CFeeRate(10000)`, which is 10 sat/byte, that comes to
//! **1000 sat per byte**, measured against the transaction's *actual* total
//! size.
//!
//! `estimate_fee` approximates that size from component counts. The
//! transparent path has `fee_covers_relay_minimum.rs` proving its model covers
//! real serialized bytes, written after a live node answered `insufficient
//! fee: 2290 < 2520`. The shielded path had no equivalent, and a shortfall
//! there is charged at 1000 sat/byte rather than 10.
//!
//! There is an opposite edge too: Core refuses a shielded transaction paying
//! more than `GetShieldedTxMinFee(tx) * 100`. The acceptable fee is a window,
//! not a floor.
//!
//! These tests are arithmetic over the model rather than built transactions,
//! because building one needs the ~50 MB Groth16 proving parameters, which CI
//! does not have. The figures they are pinned against come from a real mainnet
//! shielding transaction, recorded below, so the model is anchored to something
//! a node actually accepted rather than to itself.
