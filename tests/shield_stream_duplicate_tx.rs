//! A transaction the shield stream hands over twice must only enter the tree
//! once.
//!
//! A txid cannot legitimately appear in two blocks, so a repeat means the data
//! source is wrong. Trusting it is expensive in a way that hides itself: the
//! duplicate's commitments enter the commitment tree a second time, every
//! position after them shifts, and the root stops matching the chain. Notes
//! still decrypt, balances still read correctly, and nothing looks wrong until
//! a spend is built against the bad anchor and the network refuses it with
//! `bad-txns-shielded-requirements-not-met`. At that point the funds appear
//! stuck for no visible reason.
//!
//! This is a real failure, not a hypothetical one. PIVX's `getshielddata`
//! served transaction
//! `ba5528e825549230fe70e6baac0b13756c8dcfad3122d0ad3c60b03de56be805` twice,
//! attributed to blocks 5563567 and 5563568. The chain puts it only in
//! 5563568; block 5563567 carries no shielded transaction at all. A wallet
//! synced across that block computed a root matching nothing on the network,
//! and every shield spend afterwards was rejected. Discarding the repeat
//! restores an exact match with the node's `finalsaplingroot`.
//!
//! The bug was invisible to every existing test because they all build against
//! a tree this crate computed itself, and a tree checked only against itself
//! agrees with itself even when it is wrong. It also sat past the last embedded
//! checkpoint, which is the one region `checkpoint_audit` structurally cannot
//! cover, since it verifies consecutive checkpoint pairs and there is no
//! checkpoint after it.
