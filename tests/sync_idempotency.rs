//! Applying shield blocks must be idempotent by block height.
//!
//! Applying a block twice advances the commitment tree twice and re-adds notes
//! the wallet already holds. The inflated balance is the visible symptom; the
//! damaging part is that every witness position shifts, so anchors derived from
//! them no longer match the chain and every spend built afterwards is rejected.
//!
//! This was reachable by following the kit's own documented sync pattern.
//! Applying blocks did not advance `last_block`: only `reset_to_checkpoint` set
//! it, so a caller syncing from `last_block + 1` re-fetched and re-applied the
//! whole range from the checkpoint on every sync after the first.
