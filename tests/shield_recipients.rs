//! Recipient validation and fee-shape tests for multi-recipient shield sends.
//!
//! Building an actual shield transaction needs the ~50MB Groth16 proving
//! parameters, which are the consumer's responsibility and deliberately absent
//! from this repo. Everything *around* the proof is testable without them:
//! which recipients are accepted, how the output shape is derived, and whether
//! the fee estimator still agrees with the builder.
//!
//! The proving path itself is exercised against real params in the WASM
//! harness. What matters here is that the fee shape a recipient list implies
//! is correct, because an under-estimate strands a transaction unconfirmed
//! with no error anyone can trace back to this code.
